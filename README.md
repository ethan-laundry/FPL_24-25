Ongoing collection of statistical models for Fantasy Premier League 2024-25 season. 

data from https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League

initial ideas:

eda and anova --fpl points by player stats in previous gameweeks

overvalued/undervalued model
gameweek predictions model --top scorers and differentials

other factors: 

fixtures & team strength 
recency
injury
age
unaccounted rotation risk / key transfers to consider
